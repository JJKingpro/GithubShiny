GitHub Repository [AI] Analysis Dashboard
Description
This project is a comprehensive GitHub repository finder and analysis tool that integrates with the GitHub API and leverages AI capabilities such as the Gemini 1.5 Flash LLM. It provides a detailed analysis of repositories, including visualizations and insights. The application uses a Python-based frontend developed using the Shiny library and a robust backend that handles API requests, data fetching, and AI-powered analysis.

Features
GitHub Integration: Fetch repository data using the GitHub API.
AI-Enhanced Analysis: Analyze repositories with AI models like Gemini 1.5 and LangChain.
Data Visualization: Generate visualizations of repository metrics such as commit activity and top contributors.
Custom Queries: Users can input custom questions for AI-powered responses.
User-Friendly Interface: Developed with Shiny, providing an interactive and intuitive UI.
Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
Pip (Python package manager)
GitHub Account and Personal Access Token
Hugging Face Account and API Key
Python Libraries:

shiny
aiohttp
requests
matplotlib
google-generativeai
langchain
github
diskcache
faiss
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
cd yourrepository
Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Required Packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Environment Variables:

Create a .env file in the root directory.
Add your GitHub token and Hugging Face API key to the .env file as follows:
makefile
Copy code
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key_here
Prepare the Backend:

The backend is implemented in repo_analysis.py. This handles data fetching, AI analysis, and more.
Prepare the Frontend:

The frontend interface is implemented in app.py using the Shiny library. This script defines the layout and interactive components of the app.
Usage
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the Interface:

Once the server starts, the Shiny app will be accessible in your web browser. You can input a GitHub repository URL, select or enter a custom question, and analyze the repository.
Explore Results:

Navigate through the different panels (GitHub Repository Analysis, Visualization, Data Flowchart) to explore the results of your analysis.
Deployment
To deploy this application using ShinyApps.io or any other Shiny server, follow the deployment instructions specific to the platform, ensuring all required packages are available on the server.
